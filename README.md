Optimization of manufacturing defect rate using data-driven techniques
# Manufacturing Defect Rate Optimization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on minimizing defect rate in a manufacturing process using a data-driven optimization approach.  
The objective is to support better operational decision-making by identifying optimal process conditions that reduce defects while maintaining efficiency.

Rather than treating defect reduction as a trial-and-error problem, this project demonstrates how historical manufacturing data can be used to systematically optimize production performance.

## Business Problem
In manufacturing environments, high defect rates directly impact:
- Production cost
- Rework and scrap
- Delivery timelines
- Customer satisfaction

The challenge is that defect rate is influenced by multiple interconnected process, maintenance, workforce, and supply-chain factors.  
This project frames defect reduction as an optimization problem where controllable operational parameters are adjusted to achieve the lowest possible defect rate.

## Data Description
The dataset represents **structured, historical manufacturing process data** generated from production and quality monitoring systems.

It includes numerical variables related to:
- Supplier quality and delivery reliability
- Maintenance effort and machine downtime
- Inventory and stock availability
- Workforce productivity and safety
- Energy usage and efficiency
- Additional processing time and material cost

The data is **process-oriented and industry-agnostic**, meaning the framework is applicable across different manufacturing domains such as industrial goods, FMCG, or discrete manufacturing.

## Approach
The project follows a structured analytics workflow:

1. **Variable Selection**  
   Key operational variables influencing defect rate were identified to ensure model stability and realistic decision-making.

2. **Problem Formulation**  
   Defect rate was expressed as a function of selected controllable process parameters to capture their combined impact.

3. **Optimization**  
   Various optimization techniques were applied to identify operating conditions that minimize defect rate.

4. **Validation**  
   Consistent optimization results across methods ensured robustness and reliability of the solution.

## Key Insights
- Maintenance effort plays a critical balancing role in defect reduction.
- Both under-maintenance and excessive maintenance increase inefficiency and defects.
- Optimized operating conditions reduce defect rate without compromising productivity.
- Data-driven optimization provides more reliable decisions than intuition-based adjustments.

## Industry Relevance
This project demonstrates how optimization techniques can be embedded into:
- Quality control systems
- Production planning workflows
- Operational decision-support tools

With integration of real-time production or IoT data, the framework can be extended to continuous monitoring and dynamic optimization of manufacturing processes.
